Excited to share my recent project where I developed a machine learning model to predict car prices using regression modeling techniques. Leveraging Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn and pandas, I explored various regression algorithms to build a robust predictive model.

Key Highlights:

📊 Data Exploration: Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between car features such as mileage, year, brand, engine size, and price. Identified potential outliers and missing values for preprocessing

🔍 Model Selection: Experimented with multiple regression algorithms including Linear Regression, CatBoostRegression to identify the best-performing model.

📉 Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Implemented cross-validation to assess model generalization.

💡 Insights and Recommendations: Derived actionable insights from the model to understand the factors influencing car prices. Provided recommendations for pricing strategies and inventory management based on predictive analytics.
